            <p class="description">The Verge is an ambitious multimedia effort founded in 2011 to examine how technology will change life in the future for a massive mainstream audience. Our original editorial insight was that technology had migrated from the far fringes of the culture to the absolute center as mobile technology created a new generation of digital consumers. Now, we live in a dazzling world of screens that has ushered in revolutions in media, transportation, and science. The future is arriving faster than ever.</p>

                <p>With the Game Developers Conference not taking place as planned, Facebook is instead making a series of Oculus-related announcements this week through what it’s calling the Game Developers Showcase. The first big news, however, is mostly about Facebook’s own software: <mark>Oculus Quest is getting a major UI overhaul</mark> that the company says represents “a step toward VR becoming the next computing platform.”</p>
                <p>Right now, the Quest’s main UI involves a somewhat confusingly arranged floating menu system that appears in a virtual living room whenever you push the Oculus button. The new menu looks to be stripped down and easier to navigate, and it can also be brought up right inside apps to access system functionality without returning to the home interface.</p>
                <p>Oculus is also adding multi-window support for the Quest, beginning with the built-in web browser. You’ll be able to open, close, and rearrange windows around you, like having three giant floating monitors — Oculus suggests, for example, watching a gameplay video in one, reading news on the next, and (of course) checking in on. Support for other apps like the store and Chats will come later.</p>
                <blockquote>The VR platform of the future must enable people to multitask easily, navigate between apps seamlessly, stay connected with others, and quite simply do more, <cite>Facebook</cite> says in a blog post. From gaming to media and entertainment, from social experiences to getting work done, VR as the next computing platform will support the full spectrum of uses that people expect from their devices, like phones and laptops, today.</blockquote>
                <p>The Oculus Quest is primarily a self-contained games console right now, though, and Facebook is also highlighting its success in that regard. More than 20 titles have brought in over $1 million in revenue just on the Quest alone, according to the company, and 90 percent of people who started using the headset over the holidays hadn’t owned an Oculus product before.</p>
                <p>The new software updates will start rolling out this month, though you’ll have to switch them on yourself in the Experimental Features section of the settings menu to get them first.</p>
                <p>So far, the stock only seems to be available through Oculus, but both the 64GB ($399) and 128GB ($499) models are available. Best Buy, Amazon, and other retailers that normally sell the Quest don’t appear to have received units just yet.</p>
                <p>Controller-free hand tracking was first rolled out for Quest headsets in December, but it users had to manually toggle it on and off from the main menu each time they wanted to use it. After installing the new “v13” update, though, if you have controller-free hand tracking switched on in your Oculus Quest’s settings menu, you should just be able to put your Touch controllers down to have your Quest start tracking your hands.</p>
                <p>As cool as the feature looks, though, there isn’t much you can do with it just yet. There aren’t any games on the Oculus Store that support controller-free hand tracking right now, according to UploadVR, so it’s only something you can play with in the Quest’s built-in apps and in the virtual Oculus Home launcher. And the hand-tracking option is still in the <mark>“Experimental”</mark> tab of Settings, reports UploadVR, so it’s likely Oculus may tinker with how the technology works in future updates.</p>

                <h2>Sony and Microsoft are revealing their new consoles in the most boring way possible</h2>
                <p>Both companies have decided that the first and most important message to give customers and developers is about the pure hardware specifications. And so, just over half a year away from these consoles launching, the only thing we really know about them is cold, hard numbers: how fast the processors are; how many compute units the GPUs have; how quickly the SSDs can process data; how much RAM they have; and, of course, the often-bragged-about teraflop count.</p>

                <h2>Google now giving away three months of Stadia access to Chromecast owners</h2>
                <p>Google is slowly but steadily opening its Stadia cloud gaming service to more interested customers, with a new promotion starting this month that offers three months of its Stadia Pro subscription to owners of Chromecast Ultra devices. It’s not required that you buy a new device. Rather, you just have to opt to receive promotional emails from Google, and the company is sending out the offer to known Chromecast Ultra-owning customers.</p>

                <h2>Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are cheaper than ever at Nordstrom</h2>
                <p>Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are $100 off right now at Nordstrom, a store usually known for deals on clothing, not gadgets. This model usually sells for $400, but Wirecutter Deals pointed out that you can snag them for $300 in black or silver. The 700s have seen a minor price drop here and there but nothing more than <em>$50</em> since they released in mid-2019.</p>

                <p>Over the past few years, regulators have taken a newfound interest in the size and power of big tech companies. There’s a growing sense that the major tech platforms aren’t up to the task of governing their users — something the companies themselves will occasionally admit. And while governments deliberate on new data privacy laws, most of the action is coming from government investigations and lawsuits.</p>
